# Advent of Code 2015
My solutions (using Python) for [Advent of Code 2015](https://adventofcode.com/2015).

For each day there are two files: 
* `XX_input.txt`: this file contains the input 
* `XX_solution.py`: this file contains the solution

You can generate a pair of input/solution files by executing the script `setup-script.bash`. This script creates a boilerplate solution file using the template `solution_template.py`.

Example usage (for day x): `. setup-script.bash x` 

The puzzle input must be copied manually into the generated input file. The generated solution file contains a link (at the top) to the puzzle input.
