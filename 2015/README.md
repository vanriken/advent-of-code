# Advent of Code 2017
My solutions (using Python) for [Advent of Code 2015](https://adventofcode.com/2015).

To start working on a challenge, execute the bash script:
* Use Ubuntu terminal (or git bash in Windows)
* `. setup-script.bash <day-number>` 
* The script creates the input/solution file
* The script makes some replacements in the solution file

After this, manually copy-paste the puzzle input into the input file and solve the challenge in the file `XX-solution.py`.
